# Inventory Use Case

The inventory provided here is only for governance purposes. As such it only contains
license, version and usage information.

The ae-core project does not provide its own documentation as the producing modules required
ae-core. To bootstrap ae-core to and control that used artifacts this level of validation is
appropriate here. 

Documentation for ae-core is provided on a different level.
