        <p id="scoring">
            This report uses both the CVSSv2 Score (Score<sub>v2</sub>) and the CVSSv3 Base Score (Score<sub>v3</sub>).
            For comparison of CVSS scores Score<sub>max</sub> - the maximum of Score<sub>v2</sub> and
            Score<sub>v3</sub> - is used.
        </p>
        <p id="threshold">
            In general, only vulnerabilities with Score<sub>max</sub> higher or equal a threshold of $threshold are
            considered relevant in the given context. Vulnerabilities with Score<sub>max</sub> lower than $threshold
            are listed as insignificant vulnerabilities.
        </p>
        <p id="categories">
            Relevant vulnerabilities are categorized as potential or not applicable vulnerabilities.
            When a vulnerability is assessed, it can be escalated as potential vulnerability or
            degraded as an insignificant vulnerability in the given context independent of its score.
