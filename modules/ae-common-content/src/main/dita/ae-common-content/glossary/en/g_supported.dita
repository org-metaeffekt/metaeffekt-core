        <p>A configuration labeled supported can be used in a production setup. ${organization.name}
            confirms that the software is running with this system configuration without impacting
            the functions of the software. ${organization.name} verifies this by using the
            configuration during quality assurance and regression testing of the software.
            Restrictions and limitations are fully documented to the best knowledge of
            ${organization.name}. Updates on known restrictions and limitations are actively
            communicated by ${organization.name}.</p></glossdef>
