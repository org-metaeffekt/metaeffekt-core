            <title>Third-Party Component Vulnerabilities</title>
            <p id="vulnerabilities">
                The vulnerabilities enlisted within this document are primarily vulnerabilities of third-party software
                or hardware components that are included within or integrated with assets of ${organization.name}. The
                fact that such a component has a known vulnerability must not necessarily mean that this vulnerability
                immediately affects the ${organization.name} assets. Vulnerabilities need to be categorized and assessed
                within the context of the asset using the affected components.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Vulnerability Categories</title>
            <p id="categories">
                Vulnerabilities of included or integrated third-party components are categorized in three categories:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Potential Vulnerabilities</b> affect functions or interfaces used by the ${organization.name}
                        assets and require an individual assessment. Whether a vulnerability imposes a risk on the
                        availability, integrity and/or confidentiality of data being processed, or functions being
                        executed by the asset, is subject to an individual assessment.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Not Applicable Vulnerabilities</b> are vulnerabilities that are associated with an included or
                        integrated third-party component, but only affect functions or interfaces that are not in use
                        or deactivated. For not applicable vulnerabilities a rationale is provided explaining why the
                        vulnerability does not affect a given asset.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Insignificant Vulnerabilities</b> are either vulnerabilities below
                        a given vulnerability score threshold or have been degraded during an assessment in a given
                        context. Insignificant vulnerabilities are nevertheless listed to provide a comprehensive view.
                        A rationale is provided in case a vulnerability was degraded to an insignificant vulnerability
                        during the vulnerability assessment.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <title>Vulnerability Assessment</title>
            <p id="assessment">
                Identified vulnerabilities are assessed in four major steps:
                <ol>
                    <li>Correlation Verification - The identified components are automatically correlated with vulnerable
                        products. The correlation may be false, incomplete or imprecise. In the correlation verification
                        step the automated mapping is reviewed and improved. Based on a precise vulnerable product
                        correlation vulnerabilities can be queried more accurately.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Applicability Check - Queried vulnerabilities are analyzed for applicability. Vulnerabilities that
                        are not applicable are documented by providing an appropriate rationale. Furthermore, vulnerabilities
                        can be degraded or escalated within the given categories.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Avoidance Check - For applicable vulnerabilities alternatives or upgrade options are validated. When
                        a defect causing the vulnerability is fixed by a newer version of the component, the update or
                        upgrade options are evaluated within the current development and release timelines.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Risk Assessment – Applicable vulnerabilities that cannot be addressed by updating, upgrading or
                        replacements are assessed to determine the imposed security risk. The vulnerability induced risk is
                        described and counter measures for the asset in operation are evaluated and documented.
                    </li>
                </ol>

            <title>Vulnerability Severity Metrics</title>
            <p id="scoring">
                Generally, vulnerability severity is measured using the <abbreviated-form keyref="cvss"/> scoring system. Currently two
                versions of the CVSS scoring system are commonly applied. This document uses both, the CVSS version 2.0 and the CVSS
                version 3.x.
            </p>
            <p>
                For comparison of vulnerabilities the overall CVSS scores Score<sub>max</sub> - the maximum of CVSS overall score
                Score<sub>v2</sub> and Score<sub>v3</sub> - is used.
            </p>

                The report uses the default CVSS severity scheme as defined in the CVSS 3.1 specification both to CVSS 2.0 and CVSS 3.x scores:

                product is represented within NVD as <abbreviated-form keyref="cpe" />; an individual vulnerability as
                <abbreviated-form keyref="cve" />.

                Advisory information is included from additional sources. These vary dependent on the product domain and target
                audience.
